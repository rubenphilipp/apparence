*Please note:* This program is at a very early stage and under
development. Thus, API changes are very likely. 

* Overview

*apparence* (nicknamed ~apr~) is a Common Lisp package aimed at working with
(moving) images.

Have a look at the [[file:examples/][examples]].

** Installation

You can find detailed installation instructions here: [[file:install.org][install.org]]. 

** Performance

As some of the processes might be quite memory-consuming, it is recommended to
adjust the dynamic heap size of SBCL, e.g.

#+begin_src shell
sbcl --dynamic-space-size 8192
# this is setting the maximum heap size to 8192 MB
#+end_src


** Compatibility

Tested with SBCL on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).

** Tests

#+begin_src lisp
(asdf:test-system :apparence)
#+end_src

*Note:* Always run tests with a fresh freshly started lisp instance.

* Dependencies

The major dependencies are:
