*Please note:* This program is at a very early stage and under development.

* Overview

*apparence* (nicknamed ~apr~) is a Common Lisp package aimed at working with
(moving) images.

As of now, it still is in a very early stage of development. 


* Compatibility

Tested with SBCL on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).

** Installation

If the dependencies won't install, try using [[https://ultralisp.org/][Ultralisp]] as a source for QuickLisp
packages:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.ultralisp.org/" :prompt nil)
#+end_src

*** Inkscape

*Note:* On Linux, there is a (known) issue with the ~inkscape~ package when
installed via ~snap~. It is thus recommended, to use ~apt~ instead of ~snap~. 

** Performance

As some of the processes might be quite memory-consuming, it is recommended to
adjust the dynamic heap size of SBCL, e.g.

#+begin_src shell
sbcl --dynamic-space-size 8192
# this is setting the maximum heap size to 8192 MB
#+end_src


* Dependencies

The major dependencies are:

- [[https://github.com/tokenrove/imago][imago]]
- [[https://github.com/ormf/cm][cm]]
- [[https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape][inkscape]] (for svg to image conversion)
- [[https://github.com/ak-coram/cl-frugal-uuid/][cl-frugal-uuid]]
