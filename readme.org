**Note:** This program is at a very early stage and under development.

*apparence* (nicknamed ~apr~) is a Common Lisp package aimed at working with
(moving) images, based on [[https://github.com/tokenrove/imago][imago]]. 

As of now, it still is in a very early stage of development. 


* Compatibility

Tested with SBCL on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).

** Performance

As some of the processes might be quite memory-consuming, it is recommended to
adjust the dynamic heap size of SBCL, e.g.

#+begin_src shell
sbcl --dynamic-space-size 8192
# this is setting the maximum heap size to 8192 MB
#+end_src


* Dependencies

The major dependencies are:

- [[https://github.com/tokenrove/imago][imago]]
- [[https://github.com/ormf/cm][cm]]
- [[https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape][inkscape]] (for svg to image conversion)
